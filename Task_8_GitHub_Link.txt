# GitHub Repository Code Guide

This document provides instructions on how to run the code from the GitHub repository and offers explanations for each file in the repository. Additionally, it offers a summary of what the code represents.

## Getting Started

### `main.py`

- **Description**: This Python file is responsible for extracting CSV files from the source and consolidating them into a single Unicode text file named 'output_all.txt.'

- **How to Run**: Execute this file to run the program.

### `output_all.txt`

- **Description**: This data file contains all CSV data in Unicode format.

### `DDL`

- **Description**: This directory contains DDL (Data Definition Language) scripts that will create all the necessary database schemas, tables, and sequences.

- **Instructions**: Run these scripts to set up the database structure and permissions.

### `CNTRL_DATA.ctl`

- **Description**: This control file is used to load data from 'output_all.txt' into an Oracle database.
