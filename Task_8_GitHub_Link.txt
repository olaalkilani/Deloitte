1- execute python code that will generate one txt unicode file contain all ANSI csv files in the folder called 'output_all.txt'.
2- run DDL scripts to create all the needed schemas, tables, sequences, permisions.
3- use CNTRL_DATA.ctl to load 'output_all.txt' file and change the dierctory in the control file to be pointed in output_all.txt file.
4- use SME_PKG.pkb to build package and run it to have a Production normalized and cleaned data.

-- note the above steps should be done to get the results however this is not the ultimate solution as the design.
